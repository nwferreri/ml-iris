# Machine Learning - Iris Dataset

My first machine learning project using the classic [Iris Species dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris).

**Problem**
>Predict the species of iris based on an image of the flower.

Data was imported and split into training and test sets.  The model used was a K-nearest neighbors classifier.  The evaluation metric used was accuracy.

The model was saved and reloaded into the notebook.
